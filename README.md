# WeatherAPI
This project is a NodeJS project that takes an address, makes a call to the Google Maps geocode API, returns a lat/long which populates a call to the weather forecast API at http://forecast.io. Right now you have to run it through the command line. 

Looking to create error handling, deconstruct Google Maps API url construction to hook up to HTML form fields later. Need to dig into parsing and cleaning useful parts of forecast JSON and feed into UI.
